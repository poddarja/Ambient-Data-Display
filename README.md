Title: Grapevine Glow: Illuminating Bordeaux's Grape Harvests Climate Story 

https://cp.copernicus.org/articles/8/1403/2012/

Our project involves creating a light up representation of grape clusters, wherein LED-lit grapes symbolize historical grape harvest data from Bordeaux spanning 1733 to 2006, showcasing the gradual shift in harvest dates due to climate change. The location of this piece is a winery or wine museum exhibit in Bordeaux focusing on the intersection of wine growing and climate change. The audience is visitors of this museum which could be a popular tourist attraction. The LED grapevine is arranged linearly, resembling a timeline, to represent the trend of earlier grape harvest dates over time.
