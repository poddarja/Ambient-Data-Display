Grapevine Glow

https://cp.copernicus.org/articles/8/1403/2012/

Our project involves creating a light up representation of grape clusters, wherein LED-lit grapes symbolize historical grape harvest data from Bordeaux spanning 1733 to 2006, showcasing the gradual shift in harvest dates due to climate change. Visitors (could be tourist attraction) to a wine museum exhibit in Bordeaux focusing on the intersection of winegrowing and climate change, where our illuminated grape cluster serves as an engaging visual metaphor, situated among displays detailing the science of grape harvesting practices and environmental impacts.
