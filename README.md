Title: Grapevine Glow: Illuminating Bordeaux's Grape Harvests Climate Story 

https://cp.copernicus.org/articles/8/1403/2012/

Our project involves creating a light up representation of grape clusters, wherein LED-lit grapes symbolize historical grape harvest data from Bordeaux spanning 1733 to 2006, showcasing the gradual shift in harvest dates due to climate change. Visitors (could be tourist attraction) to a wine museum exhibit in Bordeaux focusing on the intersection of wine growing and climate change would view this piece. The LED grape vine is arranged linearly, resembling a timeline, to represent the trend of earlier grape harvest dates over time.
